<!--If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
				    <div class="navbar-header">
				        <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{url_for('home')}}">
				            <span><img src="/static/2.png" width="50" alt=""/></span>

jsDelivr provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:

jsDelivr:
 Latest compiled and minified CSS 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">

 jQuery library 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.slim.min.js"></script>

Popper JS 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>

 Latest compiled JavaScript 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>



Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.




Bootstrap 4 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">


Containers

Bootstrap 4 also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

There are two container classes to choose from:

The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container lean=ving some width off the ends

The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
